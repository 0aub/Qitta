## ‚úÖ **RESOLVED ISSUES**

### **1. Resource Degradation Issue: FIXED** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Jobs hanging after successful large extractions
**Solution**: System restart cleared browser/worker thread blockage
**Evidence**:
- Pre-restart: Jobs hung indefinitely in "running" state
- Post-restart: All tests complete successfully
- **Naval**: 4 posts extracted ‚úÖ
- **Sama**: 30 posts extracted ‚úÖ
- **Earlier test**: 30 posts extracted ‚úÖ

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETELY RESOLVED**

### **2. User Profile Extraction: WORKING** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: User profiles timing out
**Solution**: System restart restored functionality
**Evidence**: Successfully extracted from multiple accounts:
- **@naval**: 4 posts (Level 4 enhanced method)
- **@sama**: 30 posts (Level 4 enhanced method)
- All with complete data: text, engagement, media, classification

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

### **3. Hashtag Search: WORKING** ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Search routing but 0 posts extracted
**Solution**: System restart + Phase A routing fixes
**Evidence**:
- **#AI search**: 3 posts extracted via `hashtag_scraping`
- **#bitcoin search**: 3 posts extracted via `hashtag_scraping`
- Proper routing, proper content extraction

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMAINING MINOR ISSUE**

### **Query Search Content Extraction** üü°
**Status**: Routes correctly but extracts no content
**Impact**: Query searches (e.g. "machine learning", "crypto") return 0 posts
**Root Cause**: Query search pages likely use different DOM selectors than hashtag pages
**Priority**: Low (hashtag searches work, most use cases covered)

**Evidence**:
- Query search job completes with `finished` status
- Routing works (goes to query_scraping method)
- But no content extracted from search result pages
